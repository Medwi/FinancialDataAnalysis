*CAN_SLIM_Tester.ipynb:* This Jupyter Notebook contains a project that explores how stock fundamentals, specifically Earnings Per Share (EPS), Annual Earnings Growth, and Return on Equity (ROE), affect stock price increases in the following quarter, based on the CAN SLIM investing model by William J. O'Neil. They will also consider subjective factors like product innovation and leadership. I hypothesizes that EPS, ROE, and Sales Increase won't show strong correlation with stock price individually, and may only exhibit slight correlation when combined, attributing this to the chaotic nature of the stock market. 

*canslim.py:* This Python script performs stock screening based on the CAN SLIM investing model, analyzing key metrics like EPS growth rate, Return on Equity (ROE), and trading volume. It fetches financial data from MacroTrends and uses the yfinance library to assess market trends and sector performance. The script evaluates whether a stock meets specific criteria—such as strong EPS growth, high ROE, increased trading volume, and market leadership—before determining its qualification for investment.
 

*gold_simple_ARIMA_forecast_15-09-24.ipynb:* This Jupyter notebook forecasts the price of XAU/USD (Gold/US Dollar) for the upcoming week based on current market data and technical analysis. As of September 15, 2024, the price is around $2,560, with bullish sentiment due to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The analysis transitions to predicting the GLD (SPDR Gold Shares) price using historical data and linear regression models. The model, which includes daily price data since January 2023, predicts modest increases over the next week, suggesting a price of approximately $221.05 by the end of the week. While the model demonstrates a good fit with an R-squared score of 0.77, it acknowledges the limitations of simple linear regression and the influence of external factors on gold prices. 


*lstm_crypto_price_prediction.ipynb:* This script predicts Bitcoin and Ethereum prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It fetches historical market data from CoinMarketCap, preprocesses it for consistency, and trains an LSTM model on the data to forecast future prices. Visualization functions are included to compare predicted and actual prices, providing insights into the model's performance.
 

*momentum_screener.py:* This script screens stocks based on their historical performance using metrics like the HQM score and dual momentum. It downloads price data from Yahoo Finance, calculates returns over various periods, and computes momentum percentiles. Stocks with an HQM score of 75 or more are identified, and dual momentum checks are performed to find those exceeding 50% in both absolute and relative momentum. The results are printed, highlighting stocks that meet both criteria.


*pb.py:* This script calculates the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio change for a specified stock over the past five years. It retrieves quarterly balance sheet data to find the book value and historical price data from Yahoo Finance. The script aligns these datasets, computes the P/B ratio, and logs the results for transparency. The output displays the P/B ratio and its change for each quarter, allowing for easy tracking of the stock's valuation relative to its book value. 

    
*pred.py:* This script facilitates the execution of multiple prediction scripts for a given stock symbol over a specified date range. It accepts command-line arguments for the stock symbol, start date, and end date, with the option to input these values interactively. The script then iterates through a list of predefined prediction scripts, running each one with the provided parameters. Additionally, it includes a function to interact with a Hugging Face API to generate responses based on a prompt, demonstrating integration with natural language processing capabilities.  It is a framework, and obviously incomplete without the other python scripts which compose it, but it showcases the general structure of the project.

*sp500.py:* This script retrieves the historical daily market data for the S&P 500 index over the past year using the Yahoo Finance API. It resets the index to include the date as a column and then saves the resulting data to a CSV file named "sp500_daily_data_last_year.csv." The script concludes by printing a confirmation message indicating that the data has been saved successfully.  

*stack.py* This script implements a machine learning model to predict the closing prices of the S&P 500 index based on historical data. It starts by loading the dataset and selecting relevant features (Open, High, Low, Volume) while scaling them for better performance. An Encoder model is defined using PyTorch, which compresses the input features into a lower-dimensional representation. The model is trained over a set number of epochs, with the encoded output being used as input for various ensemble regression models (like AdaBoost, Random Forest, etc.). The predictions from these models are then evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R². Finally, the script generates predictions for the next 30 days, rescaling the output back to the original price range, and visualizes both the actual and predicted prices in a plot. The code includes thorough logging and evaluation of the model's performance across different methods.
